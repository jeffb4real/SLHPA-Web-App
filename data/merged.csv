It is constructed upon the same principle as my 50 horsepower engine with the same exception stated in description of the small engine shown on the 17th page of the circular - that is, the engineer's cab is in the center of the engine instead of at the rear of the boiler. But the cab can be placed on these smaller engines in the same locality as on the large one if desired. Its size had been constructed to meet demand for a traction engine for middle-sized farms. It is a powerful machine, yet is readily handled and exceedingly convenient for this class of farms...""
