<!-- Template namespacing

Now we might be able to get away with putting our templates directly in polls/templates (rather than creating another polls subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first template it finds whose name matches, and if you had a template with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the easiest way to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting those templates inside another directory named for the application itself.

        The problem with this partially hardcoded, tightly-coupled approach is that it becomes challenging to change URLs on projects with a lot of templates.

        <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

        -->
        <!-- This way uses \{\% url \%\} to remove a reliance on specific URL paths defined in the url configurations.

        <li><a href="{\% url 'detail' question.id \%}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

        -->
        <li><a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
