# Destroying test database for alias 'default'...



# tutorial05
# Test methods must reside within a class that is a subclass
# of django.test.TestCase; and must begin with keyword 'test'
# 
# Here we have created a django.test.TestCase subclass.
#
# To run tests:
# $ python manage.py test polls
#
# What happened is this:
# - manage.py test polls looked for tests in the polls application
# - it found a subclass of the django.test.TestCase class
# - it created a special database for the purpose of testing
# - it looked for test methods - ones whose names begin with test
# - in test_was_published_recently_with_future_question it created a Question instance
#   whose pub_date field is 30 days in the future
# ...and using the assertIs() method, it discovered that its was_published_recently()
#   returns True, though we wanted it to return False
# The test informs us which test failed and even the line on which the failure occurred.
